c-ares version 1.22.0

This is a feature release with some significant internal changes.

Features:
 o ares_reinit() is now implemented to re-read any system configuration and
   immediately apply to an existing ares channel [2]
 o The adig command line program has been rewritten and its format now more
   closely matches that of BIND's dig utility [3]
 o The new DNS message parser and writer functions have now been made public [4]
 o RFC9460 HTTPS and SVCB records are now supported [5]
 o RFC6698 TLSA records are now supported [6]
 o The server list is now internally dynamic and can be changed without
   impacting existing queries [10]
 o Hosts file processing is now cached until the file is detected to be changed
   to speed up repetitive lookups of large hosts files [11]

Changes:
 o Internally all DNS messages are now written using the new DNS writing
   functions [7]
 o EDNS is now enabled by default [8]
 o Internal cleanups in function prototypes [9]

Bug Fixes:
 o Randomize retry penalties to prevent thundering herd issues when dns
   servers throttle requests [1]
 o Fix Windows build error for missing if_indextoname() [10]
