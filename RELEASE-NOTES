c-ares version 1.22.1

This is a bugfix release.

Bug Fixes:
 o Fix /etc/hosts processing performance with all entries using same IP
   address. Large hosts files using the same IP address for all entries
   could use exponential time. [1]
 o Fix typos in manpages [2]
 o Fix OpenWatcom building [3]
